# ðŸ’³ Bank Application - Spring Boot Project

A RESTful **Bank Account Management System** built with Java 21 and Spring Boot. This application allows users to **Create, Read, Update, and Delete** (CRUD) bank account details via exposed HTTP endpoints.

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement

Building and maintaining a bank's backend system is crucial for managing customer accounts securely and efficiently. Most traditional systems either lack scalability or involve complex integration with databases and APIs. There is a need for a lightweight, modular, and easily testable application that performs core banking operations (such as opening, viewing, editing, and deleting bank accounts) and is easily extensible for future features like transaction history, authentication, etc.

To solve this, we propose a RESTful backend application using Spring Boot, designed with layered architecture and powered by modern tools like JPA and MySQL.
